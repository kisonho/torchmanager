    """
    Extract sliding windows from a multi-dimensional `torch.Tensor`.

    - Parameters:
        - image: The input image `torch.Tensor`. Can have any number of dimensions.
        - window_size: A `tuple` of the size of the sliding window in `int` to extract from the image, must have the same number of dimensions as the input image tensor.
        - stride: A `tuple` of the stride of the sliding window in `int`, must have the same number of dimensions as the input image tensor.
    Returns: A `list` of `torch.Tensor`, where each tensor corresponds to a sliding window extracted from the input image tensor.
    Raises: `ValueError` if the window size or stride are not valid for the input image tensor.

    Example:
    ```
    >>> image = torch.randn(3, 224, 224)
    >>> window_size = (64, 64)
    >>> stride = (32, 32)
    >>> windows = sliding_window(image, window_size, stride)
    >>> windows.shape[0]
    36
